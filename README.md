### Mileage Tracker
This simple React app allows you to keep track of your fuel mileage
Some of the features are:
- Supports imperial and metric
- Calculates your total distance driven, fuel used, and average mileage
- Saves your info for in your browser (must use the same browser) so you can keep track over time
- Supports offline use if your browser supports service workers

There's tons of cool plans and ideas I have, but I have tons of other project ideas too. It's hard to say what I'll have time to add so PR's are welcome, if you want to contribute!
